# Yammy - Secure PHP Package Manager

**Yammy** is a security-first PHP package manager that prioritizes integrity verification and safe package installation. Unlike traditional package managers, Yammy uses a quarantine system and cryptographic hash verification to ensure packages are never executed before being verified as safe.

> ⚠️ This is a work-in-progress hobby project, your production code should not rely on it!

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Add yammy to your PATH
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/yammy/bin"

# Or create symlink
ln -s /path/to/yammy/bin/yammy /usr/local/bin/yammy
```

### Create Project

make a yammy.yaml file:
```yaml
name: my-app
require:
  vendor/package: 1.2.3
packages:
  vendor/package:
    src: "https://github.com/vendor/package"
    hash: "ABC123DEF456"
```

```bash
# Install packages
yammy install
```

### Verify Integrity

```bash
# Check all packages
yammy check-integrity

# Generate hash for new package
yammy generate-hash ./yammies/my-package
```

---

## Commands

### `yammy install`
Install all packages defined in `yammy.yaml`

**Security features:**
- Downloads to quarantine first
- Verifies hash before moving to production
- Fails fast on integrity violations
- Keeps compromised packages isolated

**Example:**
```bash
$ yammy install
Starting package installation...

Downloading vendor/package to quarantine...
Downloaded from https://github.com/vendor/package
Verifying package integrity...
Hash verification passed
Installed vendor/package (1.2.3) from https://github.com/vendor/package

Lock file saved: yammy.lock
Installation complete!
```

### `yammy check-integrity`
Verify integrity of installed packages

**Use cases:**
- Post-deployment verification
- Detect tampering
- CI/CD security gates
- Regular audits

**Example:**
```bash
$ yammy check-integrity
Checking package integrity...

vendor/package: integrity OK
vendor/other: no hash specified
   Current hash: DEF789GHI012

All packages passed integrity check
```

### `yammy generate-hash <directory>`
Generate hash for a package

**Usage:**
```bash
# Generate hash for current directory
yammy generate-hash .

# Generate hash for specific package
yammy generate-hash ./yammies/vendor/package

# Output: ABC123DEF456
```

### `yammy clean-quarantine`
Remove all packages from quarantine

**When to use:**
- After reviewing failed installations
- Cleanup disk space
- Before fresh install

**Example:**
```bash
$ yammy clean-quarantine
Removed: my-package_1708789200
Cleaned 1 quarantined package(s)
```

### `yammy help`
Display help and usage information

## Security Model

### Quarantine System

```
Download → Quarantine → Verify Hash → Move to Production
                ↓ (if failed)
          Stay in .quarantine/
```

**Key principles:**
1. Never execute untrusted code
2. Verify before trust
3. Fail securely (keep evidence)

### Hash Verification

**What's hashed:**
- All `.php`, `.phtml`, `.html`, `.js`, `.yaml` files
- Recursive through directories
- Excludes: `.git/`, `yammy.lock`, symlinks

**Algorithm:**
- xxHash64 (fast, collision-resistant)
- Can be upgraded to SHA-256 in future

**Verification flow:**
```php
1. Download package to quarantine
2. Compute actual hash
3. Compare with expected hash
4. if (match) → Move to production
   else       → Keep in quarantine, alert user
```

### Security Guarantees

✅ **Integrity**: Cryptographic hash verification  
✅ **Isolation**: Quarantine system prevents execution of unverified code  
✅ **Auditability**: Security logs track all operations  
✅ **Validation**: All inputs sanitized and validated  
✅ **Safe Defaults**: Hash verification required by default  

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for complete security documentation.

## Troubleshooting

### "YAML extension is required"

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install php-yaml

# macOS
brew install php
pecl install yaml

# From source
pecl install yaml
echo "extension=yaml.so" >> /etc/php/conf.d/yaml.ini
```

### "Hash mismatch" error

1. **Expected:** Package was updated upstream
   ```bash
   # Regenerate hash
   yammy generate-hash ./yammies/.quarantine/package-name_timestamp
   # Update yammy.yaml with new hash
   ```

2. **Unexpected:** Possible compromise
   ```bash
   # DO NOT USE THE PACKAGE
   # Investigate quarantined package
   ls -la ./yammies/.quarantine/
   # Report to package maintainer
   ```

### Package stuck in quarantine

```bash
# Review the package
ls -la ./yammies/.quarantine/

# If safe, update hash in yammy.yaml
yammy generate-hash ./yammies/.quarantine/package_timestamp

# Clean up
yammy clean-quarantine
```
